```

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right of this repository
   - Clone your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vibe_code_game_template.git
     cd vibe_code_game_template
     ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Deployment 🚀

This template is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Here's how to deploy your game:

1. **Prepare Your Project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration
   - Click "Deploy"

The template includes a `vercel.json` configuration that:
- Handles client-side routing
- Optimizes asset caching for better performance
- Configures proper headers for static assets

Your game will be live at `your-project-name.vercel.app` after deployment.

## Asset Optimization

- Models: Use gltfpack to compress GLTF models
- Textures: Convert to Basis/KTX2 format
- Audio: Use MP3/OGG at 128kbps

## Performance Tips

- Use compressed textures (Basis/KTX2)
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for models
- Use procedural generation where possible
- Implement object pooling
- Use WebGL 2.0 features when available

## Vibe Coding Guide 🎯

Vibe coding is an iterative, creative approach to game development that emphasizes rapid prototyping and continuous playtesting. Here's how to get started:

1. **Vision First**: Start with a clear vision of your game's core mechanics and feel. What's the one thing that makes your game special?

2. **Incremental Vibing**: 
   - Build one feature at a time
   - Playtest after each feature
   - Adjust based on how it feels
   - Keep what works, iterate on what doesn't

3. **Playtest Early, Playtest Often**:
   - Test with real players
   - Gather feedback
   - Make quick adjustments
   - Don't be afraid to pivot

4. **Keep It Simple**:
   - Start with basic mechanics
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Focus on the fun factor
   - Remove anything that doesn't contribute to the core experience

## Example Game Ideas 🎮

Here are three simple game concepts that can be built quickly using this template:

1. **Space Hopper**
   - A zero-gravity platformer where players bounce between asteroids
   - Core mechanic: Physics-based bouncing with momentum
   - Perfect for testing procedural generation and physics

2. **Pixel Painter**
   - A multiplayer art game where players paint on a shared canvas
   - Core mechanic: Real-time color placement and blending
   - Great for testing WebSocket multiplayer and shader effects

3. **Rhythm Runner**
   - An endless runner that syncs with music beats
   - Core mechanic: Procedural level generation based on audio analysis
   - Excellent for testing audio processing and procedural generation
